# GuessQuest

A simple Python command-line game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct, and keeps track of the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number.  

## Features  

- Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.  
- Gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.  
- Tracks the number of attempts made by the user.  
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully (non-integer guesses).  

## Requirements  

- Python 3.x (for running the game).  
- No external libraries are required to run the game.  

## How to Run  

1. Clone the repository or download the `guessing_game.py` file.  
2. Run the Python script in your terminal:  
   ```bash
   python guessing_game.py
